        My current skill set is the culmination of a wide, yet interlinking,
        range of employment gained through many years of experience in working
        in client-focused and managerial positions. This spans teaching, departmental,
        project and team management including consulting.

        My approach and perspective is inherently international, cultivated through
        studying, living and working for over 20 years in many European and Asian countries.
        Studying international politics and social anthropology at universities of
        excellence across five countries while meeting the challenges and rewards
        of working in extremely multicultural settings has provided me with a truly
        unique and global perspective.

      <p>
        Thus, thinking outside the box comes as second nature and allows me to offer
        fresh perspectives by synthesizing the wealth of my personal and professional
        experience and knowledge.
